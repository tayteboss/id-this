### Try the app

## Concept
Want a tracklist from your favourite Soundcloud Mixes without having to shazam every song? I've been battling this for quite some time and have had the idea to create an app that does this for you well before I ventured into the development world. 

The concept is simple... Put the URL of a Soundcloud Mix into the app and receive a tracklist of every song in that mix.

## Technology & Concepts used
* React
* ExpressJS
* AudD API
* Axios
* Heroku
* SASS

## Challenges
### Finding an API
Within the week build, it took me 4 days just to find an API that worked for me.

### Learning React
With this being my first react project, I struggled but enjoyed learning the in's & out's of the framework.

### Communicating to APIs & Data Manipulation
Manipulating data to print onto my Front-End proved to be tough at times.

## WIP
* Ability to create a playlist on Spotify based off the tracklist you received.
* Performance Issues.
* Smoother UI transitions.
* Making tests.
